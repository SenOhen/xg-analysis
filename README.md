# xg-analysis
Data Science Capstone project exploring the xG metric in football.

# Data
This project uses data from the 2015/16 seasons of the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A soccer leagues.

# Model
The project constructs an expected goals model comparable to the benchmark (Statsbomb), using three different classifiers.

# Goal
The project seeks to answer the question: is it better to measure the quality of shots as they pertain to goals. More specifically the projects asks: over the course of a season, is it better to have fewer high quality shots, or more low quality ones?

# Permutation Feature Importance
This seeks to determine which of the features are most important when it comes to assessing the probability of a goal being scored.
